      // 3. Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return
      // either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the
      // console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!
      const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissor"];

      function computerPlay() {
         let x = choices[Math.floor((Math.random() * choices.length))];

      }
      computerPlay();





      // 4.  Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the
      // playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You
      // Lose! Paper beats Rock"
      // Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other
      // variation).
      // Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. You’re going to use what
      // you return later on, so let’s test this function by using console.log to see the results:

      // function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
      // // your code here!
      // }

      function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
         // your code here!
         if (playerSelection === computerSelection) {

            return "Match Tied, You may need to play again";

         } else if (playerSelection === "scissor" && computerSelection === "paper") {
            return "Player won with scissor beating paper";
            // pS = pS + 1;
         } else if (playerSelection === "scissor" && computerSelection === "rock") {
            return "Computer won with rock beating scissor";
            // cS = cS + 1;
         } else if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection === "paper") {
            return "Computer won with paper beating rock";
            // cS = cS + 1;
         } else if (playerSelection === "rock" && computerSelection === "scissor") {
            return "Player won with rock beating scissor";
            // pS = pS + 1;

         } else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection === "scissor") {
            return "Computer won with scissor beating paper";
            // cS = cS + 1;
         }
         else if (playerSelection === "paper" && computerSelection === "rock") {
            return "Player won with paper beating rock";
            // pS = pS + 1;

         } else {
            return "A different decision need to be specified";
         }



      }
      // const playerSelection = "rock";
      // const computerSelection = computerPlay();
      // console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

      const playerSelection = prompt("Rock, Paper or Scissor?");
      const computerSelection = computerPlay();

      let pS;
      let cS;

      console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));







      // Write a NEW function called game(). 
      function game() {
         // Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps
         // score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
         // Remember loops? This is a great opportunity to use one to play those five rounds:

         // for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // your code here! } At this point you should be using console.log() to display the
         //    results of each round and the winner at the end.
         playRound();

      }
      game();

//  Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you
//    need to. Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the
//    return value to something more useful. Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.
