      // 3. Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return
      // either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the
      // console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!
      const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissor"];

      function computerPlay() {
         let x = choices[Math.floor((Math.random() * choices.length))];
         return x;

      }
      computerPlay();

      // 4.  Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the
      // playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You
      // Lose! Paper beats Rock"
      // Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other
      // variation).
      // Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. You’re going to use what
      // you return later on, so let’s test this function by using console.log to see the results:

      // function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
      // // your code here!
      // }
      let playerWon, pcWon;
      function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
         // your code here!
         if (playerSelection === computerSelection) {
            pcWon = false;
            playerWon = false;
            return `It a tie round, Player selected ${playerSelection} while Computer also selected ${computerSelection}`;

            pcWon = false;
            playerWon = true;
